# Game of Thrones: Character Titles
# Write a function that takes a string and returns a string with the correct case for character titles in the Game of Thrones series.

# The words and, the, of and in should be lowercase.
# All other words should have the first character as uppercase and the rest lowercase.
# Examples
# correct_title("jOn SnoW, kINg IN thE noRth.")
# ➞ "Jon Snow, King in the North."

# correct_title("sansa stark, lady of winterfell.")
# ➞ "Sansa Stark, Lady of Winterfell."

# correct_title("TYRION LANNISTER, HAND OF THE QUEEN.")
# ➞ "Tyrion Lannister, Hand of the Queen."

# Notes
# Punctuation and spaces must remain in their original positions.
# Hyphenated words are considered separate words.
# Be careful with words that contain and, the, of or in.
# See the Resources tab for more info on the various Ruby string methods.
