# LCM of Two Numbers
# Write a function that returns the least common multiple 
# (LCM) of two integers.

# Examples
# lcm(9, 18) ➞ 18

# lcm(8, 5) ➞ 40

# lcm(17, 11) ➞ 187

# Notes
# Both values will be positive.
# The LCM is the smallest integer that is divisible by both 
# numbers such that the remainder is zero.
