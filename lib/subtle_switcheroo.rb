# A Subtle Switcheroo
# Create a function which replaces all instances of "nts" with "nce" and vice versa if they are at the end of a word.

# Examples
# switcheroo("The elephants in France were chased by ants!") ➞ "The elephance in Frants were chased by ance!"

# switcheroo("While he rants, I fall into a trance...") ➞ "While he rance, I fall into a trants..."

# switcheroo("Bounced over the fence!") ➞ "Bounced over the fents!"

# Notes
# Empty strings should return just an empty string (see example #2).
# Ignore punctuation and any instances where "nts" or "nce" are not at the end of a word (see example #3).
