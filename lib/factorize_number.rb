# Factorize a Number
# Create a function that takes a number as its argument 
# and returns an array of all its factors.

# Examples
# factorize(12) ➞ [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]

# factorize(4) ➞ [1, 2, 4]

# factorize(17) ➞ [1, 17]

# Notes
# The input integer will be positive.
# A factor is a number that evenly divides into another 
# number without leaving a remainder. The second example 
# is a factor of 12, because 12 / 2 = 6, with remainder 0.
