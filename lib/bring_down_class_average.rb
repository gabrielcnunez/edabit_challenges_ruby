# Bring Down the Class Average
# What is the percentage you can score on a test, which singlehandedly brings down 
# the class average by 5%? Given an array of your classmates scores, create a 
# function that returns the answer. Round to the nearest percent.

# Examples
# take_down_average(["95%", "83%", "90%", "87%", "88%", "93%"]) ➞ "54%"

# take_down_average(["10%"]) ➞ "0%"

# take_down_average(["53%", "79%"]) ➞ "51%"

# Notes
# No tests will include empty arrays or require negative percentages.
# Note that you need to return a string.
