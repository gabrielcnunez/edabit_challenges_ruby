# Rolling Cipher
# Write a function that accepts a string and an n and 
# returns a cipher by rolling each character forward (n > 0) 
# or backward (n < 0) n times.

# Note: Think of the letters as a connected loop, so rolling 
# a backwards once will yield z, and rolling z forward once will 
# yield a. If you roll 26 times in either direction, you should 
# end up back where you started.

# Examples
# rolling_cipher("abcd", 1) ➞ "bcde"

# rolling_cipher("abcd", -1) ➞ "zabc"

# rolling_cipher("abcd", 3) ➞ "defg"

# rolling_cipher("abcd", 26) ➞ "abcd"

# Notes
# All letters are lower cased.
# No spacing.
# Each character is rotated the same number of times.
