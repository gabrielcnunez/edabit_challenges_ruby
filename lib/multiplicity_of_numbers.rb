# Multiplicity of Numbers
# Write a function that returns an array of elements [number, multiplicity]. 
# The multiplicity of a number refers to the number of times it occurs in the array.

# To illustrate:

# [5, 5, 1, 1, 5, 5, 3]
# [[5, 4], [1, 2], [3, 1]]

# # Since 5 appears 4 times, 1 appears twice, and 3 appearance once.
# The final array should only include unique elements, and the elements should 
# be ordered by when they first appeared in the original array.

# Examples
# multiplicity([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]) ➞ [[1, 3], [2, 2], [3, 1]]

# multiplicity([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) ➞ [[1, 5]]

# multiplicity([1, 5, 4, 3, 2]) ➞ [[1, 1], [5, 1], [4, 1], [3, 1], [2, 1]]

# Notes
# N/A

def multiplicity(arr)
  final_array = []
  arr.tally.each do |k, v|
    final_array << [k, v]
  end
  
  final_array
