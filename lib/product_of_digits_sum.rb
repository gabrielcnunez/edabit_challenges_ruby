# Product of Digits of Sum
# Create a function that takes one, two or more numbers as arguments
# and adds them together to get a new number. The function then 
# repeatedly multiplies the digits of the new number by each other, 
# yielding a new number, until the product is only 1 digit long. 
# Return the final product.

# Examples
# sum_dig_prod(16, 28) ➞ 6
# # 16 + 28 = 44
# # 4 * 4 =  16
# # 1 * 6 = 6

# sum_dig_prod(0) ➞ 0

# sum_dig_prod(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) ➞ 2

# Notes
# The input of the function is at least one number.
