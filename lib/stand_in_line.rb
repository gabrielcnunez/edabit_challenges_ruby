# Stand in Line
# Write a function that takes an array and a number as arguments.
# Add the number to the end of the array, then remove the first
# element of the array. The function should then return the updated array.

# Examples
# next_in_line([5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 1) ➞ [6, 7, 8, 9, 1]

# next_in_line([7, 6, 3, 23, 17], 10) ➞ [6, 3, 23, 17, 10]

# next_in_line([1, 10, 20, 42 ], 6) ➞ [10, 20, 42, 6]

# next_in_line([], 6) ➞ "No array has been selected"

# Notes
# For an empty array input, return: "No array has been selected"
