# Standard Competition Ranking
# Standard competition ranking (also known as "1224" ranking) assigns the same 
# rank to matching values. Rank numbers are increased each time, so ranks are 
# sometimes skipped. If we have 5 scores (the highest score having a rank of 1):

# No matching values:

# Scores = [99, 98, 97, 96, 95]
# Rank   =   1,  2,  3,  4,  5
# With matching values:

# Scores = [99, 98, 98, 96, 95]
# Rank   =   1,  2,  2,  4,  5

# # Second and third scores are equal, so rank '3' is skipped.
# Given a hash containing the names and scores of 5 competitors, and a competitor 
# name, return the rank of that competitor after applying competition ranking.

# Examples

# competition_rank({
#   "George" => 96,
#   "Emily" => 95,
#   "Susan" => 93,
#   "Jane" => 89,
#   "Brett" => 82
#   }, "Jane") ➞ 4

# competition_rank({
#   "Kate" => 92,
#   "Carol" => 92,
#   "Jess" => 87,
#   "Bruce" => 87,
#   "Scott" => 84
#   }, "Bruce") ➞ 3

#   Notes
# The highest score has a rank value of 1.
