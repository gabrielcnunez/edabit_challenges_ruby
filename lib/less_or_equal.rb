# Less or Equal
# Mubashir needs your help in a simple task.

# Given an array of integers arr and an integer k, 
# find the lowest positive integer x so that exactly 
# k elements of the given array are less than or 
# equal to x. Return nil if the condition does not match.

# See below examples for a better understanding:

# Examples
# less_or_equal([3, 7, 6, 1, 10, 3, 20], 4) ➞ 6
# # 1, 3, 3, 6 = 4 elements
# # All elements are less than or equal to 6

# less_or_equal([3, 7, 6, 1, 10, 3, 20], 2) ➞ nil
# # 1, 3 = 2 elements
# # Not possible to return 3 because we have another 3 in the array

# less_or_equal([3, 7, 5, 1, 10, 3, 20], 4) ➞ 5
# # 1, 3, 3, 5 = 4 elements
# # All elements are less than or equal to 5

# less_or_equal([10, 15, 20, 25], 0) ➞ 1
# # k = 0

# Notes
# All numbers of the given array and k will be ≥ 0.
# Understanding the description of this challenge is the hardest part.
