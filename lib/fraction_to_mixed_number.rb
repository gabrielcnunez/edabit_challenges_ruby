# Fraction to Mixed Number
# Create a function that takes a string representing a fraction, and return a 
# string representing that input as a mixed number.

# Mixed numbers are of the form 1 2/3 — note the space between the whole number 
# portion and the fraction portion.
# Resulting fractions should be fully reduced (see example #2).
# If a result is a whole number with no fractional remainder, return only the 
# whole number portion (see example #3).
# If a result is only fractional with no whole number, return only the fractional 
# portion (see example #4).
# If a result is negative, the whole number should carry the negative sign. If the 
# result would not have a whole number portion, the numerator of the fractional 
# portion should carry the negative sign (see examples #5 - #7).

# Examples
# mixed_number("5/4") ➞ "1 1/4"

# mixed_number("6/4") ➞ "1 1/2"

# mixed_number("8/4") ➞ "2"

# mixed_number("4/6") ➞ "2/3"

# mixed_number("-1/4") ➞ "-1/4"

# mixed_number("-5/4") ➞ "-1 1/4"

# mixed_number("-8/4") ➞ "-2"

# Notes
# All provided inputs will be formatted similarly, negative numbers will be provided
# in the numerator portion only, and all inputs will contain no spaces, invalid 
# characters, or zero denominators.
