# Position in the Alphabet
# Given a number between 1-26, return what letter is at that 
# position in the alphabet. Return "invalid" if the number 
# given is not within that range, or isn't an integer.

# Examples
# letter_at_position(1) ➞ "a"

# letter_at_position(26.0) ➞ "z"

# letter_at_position(0) ➞ "invalid"

# letter_at_position(4.5) ➞ "invalid"

# Notes
# Return a lowercase letter.
# Numbers that end with ".0" are valid.
