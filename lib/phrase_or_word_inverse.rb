# Phrase or Word Inverse
# Create a function that inverts words or the phrase depending on the value 
# of parameter type. A "P" means to invert the entire phrase, while a "W" 
# means to invert every word in the phrase. See the following examples for clarity.

# Examples
# inverter("This is Valhalla", "P") ➞ "Valhalla is this"

# inverter("One fine day to start", "W") ➞ "Eno enif yad ot trats"

# inverter("Division by powers of two", "P") ➞ "Two of powers by division"

# Notes
# The first character of the returned string should be in uppercase and the 
# rest are in lowercase.
# There will be no empty strings as inputs. Punctuation marks, though quite 
# important for grammatical correctness, are discounted in the input phrases.
