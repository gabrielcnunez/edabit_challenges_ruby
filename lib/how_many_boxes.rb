# How Many Boxes?
# You work in a factory, and your job is to take items from a conveyor belt 
# and pack them into boxes. Each box can hold a maximum of 10 kgs. Given an 
# array containing the weight (in kg) of each item, how many boxes would you 
# need to pack all of the items?

# Example
# boxes([2, 1, 2, 5, 4, 3, 6, 1, 1, 9, 3, 2]) âžž 5

# # Box 1 = [2, 1, 2, 5] (10kg)
# # Box 2 = [4, 3] (7kg)
# # Box 3 = [6, 1, 1] (8kg)
# # Box 4 = [9] (9kg)
# # Box 5 = [3, 2] (5kg)

# Notes
# There will always be a minimum of 1 item to pack. All items will weigh less 
# than or equal to 10 kgs, and need to be packed in the order that they arrive.
