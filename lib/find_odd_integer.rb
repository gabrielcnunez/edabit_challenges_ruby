# Find the Odd Integer
# Create a function that takes an array and finds the integer 
# which appears an odd number of times.

# Examples
# find_odd([1, 1, 2, -2, 5, 2, 4, 4, -1, -2, 5]) ➞ -1

# find_odd([20, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 4, 20, 4, 5]) ➞ 5

# find_odd([10]) ➞ 10

# Notes
# There will always only be one integer that appears an odd number of times.
