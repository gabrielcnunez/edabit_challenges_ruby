# Breaking News!
# A local news station needs your help to generate the scrolling text for the headlines!

# Create a function that returns an array of strings, where each string contains a single 
# frame of what the scrolling text will look like.

# Text will scroll from right to left.
# The screen will have a width of n characters.
# Start and stop when no letters appear on the screen.
# The example below will demonstrate the output when the screen width is 10.

# Examples
# news_at_ten("edabit", 10) âžž [
#   "          ",
#   "         e",
#   "        ed",
#   "       eda",
#   "      edab",
#   "     edabi",
#   "    edabit",
#   "   edabit ",
#   "  edabit  ",
#   " edabit   ",
#   "edabit    ",
#   "dabit     ",
#   "abit      ",
#   "bit       ",
#   "it        ",
#   "t         ",
#   "          "
# ]

# Notes
# Every string should be n characters long, so you should pad the string with spaces 
# if the text isn't long enough.
# Similarly, if the text is too long for the screen width, then it's only possible to 
# display a fraction of the text at a time.
# See the Tests tab for more examples.

  txt_with_padding = ' ' * n + str + ' ' * n

  txt_with_padding.chars.each_cons(n) { |chars| scroll << chars.join }

  scroll
