# Amount of Fibonacci Numbers
# Create a function that returns the amount of Fibonacci numbers strictly 
# smaller than the given integer. In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers commonly 
# denoted Fn, form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each 
# number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. Thus:

# F0=0 and F1=1

# and

# Fn=F(n-1)+F(n-2)

# for n > 1
# The beginning of the sequence is thus:

# 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...
# The function should thus return 13 when called with the 
# variable n = 145 since there exist 13 Fibonacci numbers strictly smaller than 145.

# Examples
# amount_fib(0) ➞ 0

# amount_fib(1) ➞ 1

# amount_fib(3) ➞ 4

# amount_fib(22) ➞ 9

# amount_fib(145) ➞ 13
