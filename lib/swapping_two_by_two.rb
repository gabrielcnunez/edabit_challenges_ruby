# Swapping Two by Two
# Write a function that swaps the first pair (1st and 2nd characters) with 
# the second pair (3rd and 4th characters) for every quadruplet substring.

# Examples
# swap_two("ABCDEFGH") ➞ "CDABGHEF"

# swap_two("AABBCCDDEEFF") ➞ "BBAADDCCFFEE"

# swap_two("munchkins") ➞ "ncmuinhks"

# swap_two("FFGGHHI") ➞ "GGFFHHI"

# Notes
# Keep leftover strings in the same order.
