# Perfect Number
# Create a function that tests whether or not an integer is a perfect number. 
# A perfect number is a number that can be written as the sum of its factors, 
# (equal to sum of its proper divisors) excluding the number itself.

# For example, 6 is a perfect number, since 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, where 1, 2, and 3 
# are all factors of 6. Similarly, 28 is a perfect number, since 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28.

# Examples
# check_perfect(6) ➞ true

# check_perfect(28) ➞ true

# check_perfect(496) ➞ true

# check_perfect(12) ➞ false

# check_perfect(97) ➞ false

# Notes
# N/A
