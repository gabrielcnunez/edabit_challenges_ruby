# Next in the Alphabet
# Create a function which returns the next letters alphabetically in a given 
# string. If the last letter is a "Z", change the rest of the letters accordingly.

# Examples
# next_letters("A") ➞ "B"

# next_letters("ABC") ➞ "ABD"

# next_letters("Z") ➞ "AA"

# next_letters("CAZ") ➞ "CBA"

# next_letters("") ➞ "A"

# Notes
# Tests will all be in CAPITALS.
# Empty inputs should return a capital "A" (as if it were in letter position 0!).
# Think about the letter "Z" like the number 9 and how it carries over to increment 
# the next letter/digit over.
