# Dice Gambling
# Create a function that takes an array consisting of dice rolls from 1-6. 
# Return the sum of your rolls with the following conditions:

# If a 1 is rolled, that is bad luck. The next roll counts as 0.
# If a 6 is rolled, that is good luck. The next roll is multiplied by 2.
# The array length will always be 3 or higher.
# Examples
# rolls([1, 2, 3]) ➞ 4
# # The second roll, 2, counts as 0 as a result of rolling 1.

# rolls([2, 6, 2, 5]) ➞ 17
# # The 2 following the 6 was multiplied by 2.

# rolls([6, 1, 1]) ➞ 8
# # The first roll makes the second roll worth 2, but the
# # second roll was still 1 so the third roll doesn't count.

# Notes
# Even if a 6 is rolled after a 1, 6 isn't summed but the 6's "effect" still takes place.
