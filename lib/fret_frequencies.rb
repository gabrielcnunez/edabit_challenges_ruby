# Fret Frequencies on the Guitar
# Create a function that takes a number of a guitar string and the number of 
# the fret and returns the corresponding frequency of the note.

# Check the Resources Tab, for the correct frequencies per string.
# The formula to calculate the frequency is: String Frequency * 2**(fret/12).
# Round the frequency to the nearest hundreth.
# For this challenge, we use "Standard Tuning".
# So, one fret = a semitone = a half step. From D to D♯ for instance.

# Examples
# fret_freq(5, 12) ➞ 220

# fret_freq(4, 6) ➞ 207.65

# fret_freq(2, 23) ➞ 932.32
