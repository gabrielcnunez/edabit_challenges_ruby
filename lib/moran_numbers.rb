# Moran Numbers
# A Harshad number is a number which is divisible by the sum of 
# its digits. For example, 132 is divisible by 6 (1+3+2).

# A subset of the Harshad numbers are the Moran numbers. Moran numbers 
# yield a prime when divided by the sum of their digits. For example, 
# 133 divided by 7 (1+3+3) yields 19, a prime.

# Create a function that takes a number and returns "M" if the number 
# is a Moran number, "H" if it is a (non-Moran) Harshad number, or "Neither".

# Examples
# moran(132) ➞ "H"

# moran(133) ➞ "M"

# moran(134) ➞ "Neither"

# Notes
# N/A
