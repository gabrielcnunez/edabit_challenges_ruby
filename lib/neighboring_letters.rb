# Neighboring Letters
# Create a function that takes a string and checks if every 
# single character is preceded and followed by a character 
# adjacent to it in the english alphabet.

# Example: "b" should be preceded and followed by ether "a" 
# or "c" (abc || cba || aba || cbc == true but abf || zbc == false).

# Examples
# neighboring("aba") ➞ true

# neighboring("abcdedcba") ➞ true

# neighboring("efghihfe") ➞ false

# neighboring("abc") ➞ true

# neighboring("qrstuv") ➞ true

# neighboring("mnopqrstsrqponm") ➞ true

# Notes
# All test cases will consist of lower case letters only.
