# Fractions and Rounding
# Given a fraction (given in the format "1/2" for example) and n number 
# of decimal places, return a sentence in the following format:

# "{fraction} rounded to {n} decimal places is {answer}"

# Examples
# frac_round("1/3", 5) ➞ "1/3 rounded to 5 decimal places is 0.33333"

# frac_round("2/8", 4) ➞ "2/8 rounded to 4 decimal places is 0.2500"

# frac_round("22/7", 2) ➞ "22/7 rounded to 2 decimal places is 3.14"

# Notes
# Add trailing zeros if n is greater than the actual number of decimal 
# places the fraction has (see example #2).
# Numbers greater than one may be given as top-heavy fractions (no mixed 
# numbers).
# n won't be 1 because that would cause "decimal places" to be "decimal 
# place", making the challenge more cumbersome than it needs to be.
