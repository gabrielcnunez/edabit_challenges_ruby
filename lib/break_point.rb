# Break Point
# A number has a breakpoint if it can be split in a way where the 
# digits on the left side and the digits on the right side sum to 
# the same number.

# For instance, the number 35190 can be sliced between the digits 
# 351 and 90, since 3 + 5 + 1 = 9 and 9 + 0 = 9. On the other hand,
# the number 555 does not have a breakpoint (you must split 
# between digits).

# Create a function that returns true if a number has a breakpoint, 
# and false otherwise.

# Examples
# break_point(159780) ➞ true

# break_point(112) ➞ true

# break_point(1034) ➞ true

# break_point(10) ➞ false

# break_point(343) ➞ false

# Notes
# Read each digit as only one number.
