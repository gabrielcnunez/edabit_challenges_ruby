# The Snake — Area Filling
# This challenge is based on the classic videogame "Snake".

# Assume the game screen is an n * n square, and the snake 
# starts the game with length 1 (i.e. just the head) positioned 
# on the top left corner.

# For example, if n = 7 the game looks something like this:



# In this version of the game, the length of the snake doubles 
# each time it eats food (e.g. if the length is 4, after eating 
# it becomes 8).

# Create a function that takes the side n of the game screen and 
# returns the number of times the snake can eat before it runs 
# out of space in the game screen.

# Examples
# snakefill(3) ➞ 3

# snakefill(6) ➞ 5

# snakefill(24) ➞ 9

# Notes
# The given number will always be a positive integer (there are no 
# exceptions to handle).
