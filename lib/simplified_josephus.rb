# Simplified Josephus
# Given n people, find the survivor. Starting from the first person, 
# they kill the person to their left and the next surviving person 
# kills the person to their left. This keeps happening until 1 person 
# survives. Return that person's number.

# Examples
# josephus(1) ➞ 1

# josephus(8) ➞ 1

# josephus(41) ➞ 19

# Notes
# Check the resources if you are confused about the instructions.
