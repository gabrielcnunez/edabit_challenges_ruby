# Is One String in the Other?
# Create a function that takes two strings and returns true if either of the 
# strings appears at the very end of the other string. Return false otherwise. 
# The character * is a wildcard, so it can take the place of any character.

# Examples
# overlap("ABC", "Ican'tsingmyABC") ➞ true

# overlap("abc", "Ican'tsingmyABC") ➞ true

# overlap("Ican'tsingmyABC", "abc") ➞ true

# overlap("hello world", "hello") ➞ false

# overlap("+=", "this should work too +=") ➞ true

# overlap("hey", "*********") ➞ true
# Notes
# Your function should NOT be case sensitive (see example #2).

def overlap(s1, s2)
