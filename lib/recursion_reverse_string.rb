# Recursion: Reverse a String
# Write a function that reverses a string. Make your function recursive.

# Examples
# reverse("hello") ➞ "olleh"

# reverse("world") ➞ "dlrow"

# reverse("a") ➞ "a"

# reverse("") ➞ ""

# Notes
# For non-base cases, your function must call itself at least once.
# Check the Resources tab for info on recursion.
