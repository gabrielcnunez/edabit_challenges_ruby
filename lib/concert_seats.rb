# Concert Seats
# Create a function that determines whether each seat can "see" the front-stage. 
# A number can "see" the front-stage if it is strictly greater than the number before it.

# Everyone can see the front-stage in the example below:

# # FRONT STAGE
# [[1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1],
# [2, 4, 4, 3, 2, 2],
# [5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4],
# [6, 6, 7, 6, 5, 5]]

# # Starting from the left, the 6 > 5 > 2 > 1, so all numbers can see.
# # 6 > 5 > 4 > 2 - so all numbers can see, etc.
# Not everyone can see the front-stage in the example below:

# # FRONT STAGE
# [[1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1], 
# [2, 4, 4, 3, 2, 2], 
# [5, 5, 5, 10, 4, 4], 
# [6, 6, 7, 6, 5, 5]]

# # The 10 is directly in front of the 6 and blocking its view.
# The function should return true if every number can see the front-stage, and 
# false if even a single number cannot.

# Examples
# can_see_stage([
#   [1, 2, 3],
#   [4, 5, 6],
#   [7, 8, 9]
# ]) ➞ true

# can_see_stage([
#   [0, 0, 0],
#   [1, 1, 1],
#   [2, 2, 2]
# ]) ➞ true

# can_see_stage([
#   [2, 0, 0], 
#   [1, 1, 1], 
#   [2, 2, 2]
# ]) ➞ false

# can_see_stage([
#   [1, 0, 0],
#   [1, 1, 1],
#   [2, 2, 2]
# ]) ➞ false

# # Number must be strictly smaller than 
# # the number directly behind it.

# Notes
# Numbers must be strictly greater than the number in front of it.
# All numbers within the arrays will be whole numbers greater than or equal to zero.
