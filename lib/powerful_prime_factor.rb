# Powerful Prime Factor
# Create a function that takes a positive integer and returns a string expressing how 
# the number can be made by multiplying powers of its prime factors.

# Examples
# express_factors(2) ➞ "2"

# express_factors(4) ➞ "2^2"

# express_factors(10) ➞ "2 x 5"

# express_factors(60) ➞ "2^2 x 3 x 5"

# Notes
# All inputs will be positive integers in the range 1 < n < 10,000.
# If a factor is repeated express it in the form "x^y" where x is the factor and 
# y is the number of repetitions of the factor.
# If n is a prime number, return n as a string as in example #1 above.
# Factors should appear in ascending order in the expression.
# Make sure you include the space either side of the multiplication sign, " x ".
